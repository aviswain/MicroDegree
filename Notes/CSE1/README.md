# CSE 1. Logic Design of Digital Systems
Original Course: _CS M51A Winter 2024 taught by Prof. (Omid) Abari at UCLA_

## FAQ
### Why do I have to take this course?
As a CSE major, there might come a time in the future where you need to understand how a computer works from the inside-out. 
This course teaches you how to go from binary bits all the way to implementing simple devices. 

The concepts in this course will set you up for success in computer architecture.

If your focus is only on software, this course may not interest you. But you should know that this course is required in most universities
for all majors relating to computers/technology (CS, CE, CSE, EE, EECS, ...)

## Credit
The pictures I used are all from Prof. Abari's slides (THANK YOU!). It would be really hard to teach this course without them!
