These are all the notes that I have taken as an undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering major at UCLA. 

Hopefully, if someone down the road finds themselves wishing they had gotten a CS degree, this is there for them. Also maybe if someone is considering not going to college, this is also there for them. I am posting this material so that it is available to all!

I won't be posting hw assignments or project specs on here cause I view that as the school's intellectual property. I might post some projects though because I hear those change from year to year!
