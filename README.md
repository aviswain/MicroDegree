These are all the notes that I have taken as an undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering major at UCLA.

I'm not posting hw assignments or project specs on here cause I view that as the school's intellectual property. I might post some projects I implement though because I hear those change from year to year!

I am posting these to make the material I'm learning in college available to all!
