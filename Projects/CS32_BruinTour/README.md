# BruinTour
This was my final project for CS 32, which is UCLA's data structures course taught in C++. The code in the enclosed folder "provided" was code that was given by the professors. I implemented the other files in "my_work". The report.txt is a file that were required to submit along with our project. "spec.pdf" has the details of this assignment.

## Summary of project...
Automated tour guide system that loads and indexes a bunch of Open Street Map geospatial data (which contain latitude and longitude data for thousands of streets) along with a list of points of interest and then uses this data to generate a relatively optimized set of instructions for the tour.
