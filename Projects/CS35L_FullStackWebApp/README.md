## ColoredCups
Focus on understanding and peformance.
### Features
- Dynamic Content: The cup's color contents change on the speaker's POV
- Persistent Data: If a class is created, then all the listener's data will persist
  through until the class is terminated by the teacher.
- Search through server data:
  - Search through participants by name
- Security: Login authentication (Not duo or push notifications) by UID or something
  of the sort to make sure that each student is truly that student and a teacher is
  truly a teacher. The teacher can have google duo/push notification to increase
  security of the entire class' data.

- Other features should aide in presentations
  - QnA Forum.
  - Attendance (can be turned on and off)
    - Shows all active students in green and inactive students in red. Repeated absentees can be flagged if the teacher would like.
  - Ability for teacher to upload files to rest of class for that session.
