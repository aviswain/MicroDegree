## Design Decisions of this Course

### How did you choose these topics?
In every college Computer Science program, there are always three classes that first-year undergraduates have to take: Intro to Programming, Data Structures, and Computer Architecture. I made this course encompass all of them because they just build on top of each other. 

### Why did you choose Python?
Depending on the university, a certain computer programming language might be favored. For example, at the time that I am writing this, the Ohio State University uses Java for its 
intro and data structures courses while UCLA uses C++. Although colleges might favor a certain language, it is not for the reasons you might think. 

Most of the time it's because they have been teaching the language for so long and have put a lot of work into creating the educational material around it (exams, projects, homework, 
etc.). Also, the language still happens to be relevant...so there is no point in switching!

When it comes down to picking a language to learn, you don't want to choose the one that has a cool name or the one that all the experienced programmers are hyping up. While this 
might result in some motivation to start learning, it won't you last long. What you want to do is have an objective in mind (For example, want to work on data analysis, learn R! Want 
to work on performance-critical tasks, learn C++! etc.). Having a definite reason for learning a language will incentivize you to learn as much as you can about it!

I am choosing to teach this course in Python for a couple of reasons. For one, it has extensive libraries allowing it to work with all sorts of applications. Also it is heavily used 
in machine learning which is taking over everything right now. Python is also a great first language because it is extremely simple. 

### Why are you not completely explaining the basics?
This course, like most "Intro to CS" college courses, assumes a small bit of programming experience. Why do colleges do that (you might ask...)? Well since the Computer Science 
major is in such high demand, the people who end up applying and ultimately getting accepted into the major tend to have done a small bit of programming beforehand. 

If this isn't you, no need to worry. Most colleges have a course that comes even before these programming courses that assumes no prior programming experience at all! Unfortunately, I 
will not be creating a class for that course because it has been a while since I have taken it. But the resources below will do the exact same job, and way better!

### Other Details
I have decided to write this course in a way that allows me to quickly review the concepts as fast as possible. I cut out the junk and filler and have only included what is needed to get a full understanding of the topic.
