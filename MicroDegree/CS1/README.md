# CS1. Computer Programming (Python)
In every college Computer Science Program, there are always three classes that first-year undergraduates have to take: Intro to Programming, Data Structures, and Computer Archicture. 

Depending on the university, a certain computer programming language might be favored. For example, at the time that I am writing this, the Ohio State University uses Java for its intro and data structures courses while UCLA uses C++. Although colleges might favor a certain language, it is not for the reasons you might think.

## Course Objectives
Learn the foundational concepts of...
- Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
