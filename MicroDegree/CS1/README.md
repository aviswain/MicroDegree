## Design Decisions of this Course

### How did you choose these topics?
In every college Computer Science program, there are always three classes that first-year undergraduates have to take: Intro to Programming, Data Structures, and Computer Architecture. I made this course encompass all of them because they just build on top of each other. 

### Why did you choose Python?
Depending on the university, a certain computer programming language might be favored. For example, at the time that I am writing this, the Ohio State University uses Java for its intro and data structures courses while UCLA uses C++. Although colleges might favor a certain language, it is not for the reasons you might think. 

Most of the time it's because they have been teaching the language for so long and have put a lot of work into creating the educational material around it (exams, projects, homework, etc.). Also, the language still happens to be relevant...so there is no point in switching!

When it comes down to picking a language to learn, you don't want to choose the one that has a cool name or the one that all the experienced programmers are hyping up. While this might result in some motivation to start learning, it won't you last long. What you want to do is have an objective in mind (For example, want to work on data analysis, learn R! Want to work on performance-critical tasks, learn C++! etc.). Having a definite reason for learning a language will incentivize you to learn as much as you can about it!

I am choosing to teach this course in Python for a couple of reasons. For one, it has extensive libraries allowing it to work with all sorts of applications. Also it is heavily used in machine learning which is taking over everything right now. Python is also a great first language because it is extremely simple.
