# College Designed My Way
I have noticed that college has stopped me from learning in many different ways. It also sometimes even took away my inspiration to learn (which I think is extremely dangerous).
You might be thinking that makes no sense. Consider the following experiences I had:
- I got some low grades during my freshman winter quarter, which was pretty discouraging
- During the only free time I got during that quarter (which was not much), I spent 90% of it trying to learn as much as I can about neural networks. Although I learned stuff, I came
  out of it thinking that it was not worth it at all to explore my own interests during the school year because my grades suffered
- I find myself wanting to learn more and more while on break. My mind is actively looking for the next topic,
- I find myself wanting to just stop learning during the quarter. Grades reward memorization far more than understanding.

Now that you know my point of view, here is what I am doing about it:
- I've noticed that I cannot rely on my teachers anymore. I have found that the best way of utilizing the college system is to learn the material on your own. From there, wherever your
  curiosities go, ask them to the experts (i.e. the professor and TAs).
- I have found the wrong way to go is leaning on them for learning and teaching. At the end of the day, a professor might not be the best teacher but they will be an EXPERT in their
  field. Professors aren't required to get education degrees like grade-school teachers. Instead they are only qualified to teach because their understanding of a subject is at an
  extremely high level. There is a drawback to this though: there is a common enough scenario where you are getting taught by someone who is extremely smart but has no idea how to explain
  the concepts of their field to someone who has never been in it before.
    - This idea might be hard for some professors/teachers to grasp, but if you ask any college student, they will often tell you that they have experienced something like it before.
      It's just the truth. Sometimes being an genius does not qualify you as being the best teacher.

So I have decided that the best way is to learn things on my own and take notes along the way. Maybe if someone is learning on their own as well, these notes will be helpful.

What follows is a Computer Science and Engineering degree designed the way I would teach it from the way I have learned it.

## Philosophy of Teaching
1) Material will reflect exactly what you need to know in real life. I will not play games such as only doing simple examples in lecture and then testing you in complex ways on the       exam or projects. I will teach exactly how I will test.
2) If you do not understand something, do not move forward to the next lecture. I have designed each lecture in a way such that it relies on a full understanding of the topics that       come beforehand.
3) If you cheat (discuss individual-assigned work with others, look at code from others, or anything related) I don't care. But what I will say is that you are getting this degree
   to tell the world that YOU know something about CSE...not that you and your friends when put together know something about CSE. So you might get your dream job by putting this on
   your resume, but if you don't know what you are doing there and are always asking easy-to-answer questions, you will also lose your dream job by putting this on your resume (that      is if you cheat). So my advice is don't.
4) When possible I will always test your understanding by the closest format to what you will be doing in the real world. That means projects > QnA tests.
