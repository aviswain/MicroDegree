# Intro

## Systems
A system is just anything that takes some input, does something with it, and produces
an output. Systems can be broken down into two different categories, digital systems 
and analog systems. The nature of their inputs and outputs are what distinguishes them
from each other.

- **Digital Systems**: finite number of discrete values as the inputs/outputs
- **Analog Systems**: continuous (infinite) set of inputs/outputs.
