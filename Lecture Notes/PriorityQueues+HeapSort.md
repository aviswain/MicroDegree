# Priority Queues
# Heaps
- When extracting from a max heap why do we have to copy the bottom-most, right-most node to the root node? Why not just save the root node, and then move the greatest elements upward to fill its spot? Is this because we have to keep the "complete" tree structure? If so, why is it so important that we keep the complete tree structure?
